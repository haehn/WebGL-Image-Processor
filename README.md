# WebGL Image Processor
A tool used to perform live image processing on WebGL contents.

# How to use?

Currently script has to be referenced from website, it should be used from.
Code gets automatically injected in the website then.
In the next steps, external injection will be targeted.

# How to do image processing?

When on your WebGL compatible website, press "insert" key, to start the recording, then also image processing is started automatically (currently only color highlighting and simple Sobel edge detection are implemented; uncomment and comment either on of the shaders to be used in current state). Press "insert" again to stop real-time image processing.
